It is discussed in chapter 3.

To use this project, create an instance of class NumberDisplay. Then inspect this 
instance and leave the inspector window open. With the inspector window open, 
call the object's methods, such as increment and setValue.

1. LabClass would be the main class that connects to the student class(subclass) as LabClass gets the information from the Student subclass and returns the values (name, ID, credits, etc..).
2. A class diagram can change when added a new class to the project and connecting it to another class(subclass, extends). 
3. Object diagram can change when adding a new method or object created to the project.
4. 
public class MyClass {
Instructor tutor;
}
5. The values rolls over to 0 once the value hits 24.
6. You should make a getter method that pulls the vlaue of the minutes instance and rolls it over into the hours instance.
9. I predict that it will give 0
10.Error: non-static method getValue() cannot be referenced from a static context
11. Error: '.class' expected. you dont need to call the method display.setValue(int 5);  you call it without the int in the paranthesis
12.
