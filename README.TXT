This project is part of the material for the book

   Objects First with Java - A Practical Introduction using BlueJ
   Seventh edition

It is discussed in chapter 3.

To use this project, create an instance of class NumberDisplay. Then inspect this 
instance and leave the inspector window open. With the inspector window open, 
call the object's methods, such as increment and setValue.

1. LabClass would be the main class that connects to the student class(subclass) as LabClass gets the information from the Student subclass and returns the values (name, ID, credits, etc..).
2. A class diagram can change when added a new class to the project and connecting it to another class(subclass, extends). 
3. Object diagram can change when adding a new method or object created to the project.
4. 
 {
private Instructor tutor;
}
5. The values rolls over to 0 once the value hits 24.
6. You should make a getter method that pulls the vlaue of the minutes instance and rolls it over into the hours instance.
9. I predict that it will give 0
10.Error: non-static method getValue() cannot be referenced from a static context
11. Error: '.class' expected. you dont need to call the method display.setValue(int 5);  you call it without the int in the paranthesis
12. It got 10 after changing the sign
13.Any value set below the orginal roll over limit.
14.Its now registering any value set even if its over the rollover limit
15. Which of the following expressions return true?
! (4 < 5)
16.
c = a + b

if a + b = true 
    c = true
    
else a + b = false
    c = false    

17. 
    c = a + b
if a & b = true {
    c = false
    else 
    a = false
    b = true
    c= true 
    else
    a = true
    b = false
}  
18.
it returned "100"
19.
it returned 100 no quotes
20. first option would give 12cat
and the other would give cat39 ( because the first one is performing the addition and the other is just assigning another digit to the first number)
